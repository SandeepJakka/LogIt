# LogIt

LogIt is a SaaS-style developer dashboard built using WordPress.

The goal of LogIt is to help developers:
- Track projects they are working on
- Log daily learning and work
- Visualize progress over time through a dashboard

This project is built incrementally to demonstrate real-world WordPress plugin development and clean Git practices.
